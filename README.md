This repository currently contains a collection of simulators for Reinforcement Learning research.

|**Name**|**Description**|**Thread-compatible?***|**Optional?**|
|:--------------|---------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|
|**SimpleGame**|A simple 1D array-walking game.|Yes|No|
|**SimpleRace**|A simple synthetic car racing game.|Yes|No|
|**XWorld2D**|A 2D environment for an agent to learn vision and language abilities.|No|No|
|**Atari**|Wrappers for the Arcade Learning Environment ([ALE](http://www.arcadelearningenvironment.org/)) environment. For stability, we use a fork version.|Yes|Yes|

*If yes, then multithreading can be used; otherwise multiprocessing is needed.

# Requirements
* Compiler: GCC 4.8 or above
* CMake: CMake 3.0 or above
* Python: Python 2.7

# Dependencies
The following softwares must be installed before building XWorld.
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
* [Glog](https://github.com/google/glog)
* [GFlags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags)
* [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

In Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04, you can do
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev libgtest-dev python-dev
```

# Build
First get this git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/XWorld
```

Suppose the directory is `xworld_path`, then do
```
cd <xworld_path>
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake [<optional parameters>] ..
```
For example,
```
cd ~/XWorld; mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
```

Finally, in the build directory do
```
make
make test
```

By default, XWorld only builds the first three games: SimpleGame, SimpleRace, and XWorld2D. Optionally, you can install [Atari](http://www.arcadelearningenvironment.org/) by:

```
cmake -DWITH_ATARI=ON ..
```
which will automatically download and build Atari.

# Use
You can compile a C++ project with XWorld. The C++ simulator APIs are located in simulator.h ```GameSimulator```.
Alternatively, we provide a set of simple Python APIs for interacting with the simulators. After building XWorld, you need to export the path of the python module:
```
export PYTHONPATH=<xworld_path>/python:$PYTHONPATH
```
You can add the above line to ~/.bashrc to avoid doing the export in the future.

To get started, several examples of the simulator Python APIs can be found in
```
<xworld_path>/python/examples
```
And several C++ examples (run the .sh scripts inside) can be found in
```
<xworld_path>/examples
```
Generally, C++ APIs are more flexible but expose more details than Python APIs.

See [instructions](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/XWorld/tree/master/games) for how to create different games.

# Code for training XWorld2D
Currently there is a PyTorch [reimplementation](https://github.com/zihangdai/pytorch_xworld) (by [@zihangdai](https://github.com/zihangdai)) of the framework used in arXiv:1703.09831. The code runs on the whole vocabulary and does not include the zero-shot experiments, but you can choose to do so according to the zero-shot setups discussed in the paper.

# Write your own XWorld2D tasks
You can customize XWorld2D tasks in a flexible way. To define a new task, you need three things:
1. A Python class that defines the map
  * This class must be defined in a file with the same name and put in
  ```
  <xworld_path>/games/xworld/maps/
  ```
  The class has to inherit from the base class ```XWorldEnv``` (defined in ```xworld_env.py```) and overwrite the member function ```_configure``` to specify how the map is configured. For an example, please take a look at ```XWorldNav.py```.

2. A Python class that defines the task
  * This class must be defined in a file with the same name and put in
  ```
  <xworld_path>/games/xworld/tasks/
  ```
  The class has to inherit from the base class ```XWorldTask``` (defined in ```xworld_task.py```). For an example, please take a look at ```XWorldNavTarget.py```.

3. A JSON conf file. This file specifies three aspects of the world:
  * ```item_path```: where the icon images are stored. Change this variable if you have new icons.
  * ```map``` : the name of the Python class that defines the map. It should be one of the Python defined maps.
  * ```task_groups``` : how the teacher assigns multiple tasks to the agent. Each task should be one of the Python defined tasks.
  For an example, please take a look at ```<xworld_path>/confs/walls.json```.

Generally, the teacher can dynamically change the environment at every time step, potentially according to the agent's performance and/or behaviors, which is important if you want to implement curriculum learning. The teacher's sentences can be generated by a context-free grammar (```<xworld_path>/python/context_free_grammar.py```) at each time step of each task. You have to define the grammar and decide when to generate what sentence when writing a task.
